# Lab 03 - Linter 
**Feature Tasks**

 ***Map***

Iterate through all of the data to find the min and max values. Use a `HashSet` of type `Integer` to keep track of all the unique temperatures seen.
Finally, iterate from the min temp to the max temp and create a String containing any temperature not seen during the month. Return that String.

**Tallying Election**

Write a function called `tally` that accepts a List of `Strings` representing votes and returns one string to show what got the most votes.

***JavaScript Linter***

Write a method that reads a JavaScript file with a given `Path`, and generates an error message whenever it finds a line that doesnâ€™t end in a semi-colon.
